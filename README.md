# Periodic table generator

I use it to generate various SVGs for spaced-repetition study in [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

## Devshell

This repository has a [devshell](https://github.com/numtide/devshell) configured for Linux and macOS machines, both x86-64, and AArch64. To use it, please:

1. Install:
    * [Nix](https://nixos.org/download/),
    * [direnv](https://direnv.net/),
    * optionally: [nix-direnv](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv) for a slightly better performance, if itâ€™s easy for you to enable, e.g. on NixOS, [nix-darwin](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin), using [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) etc.
2. Enter the cloned directory.
3. And run `direnv allow`.

### Pure Nix builds

You can also use `nix build` to build the package.

If in doubt, run `nix flake show`.
